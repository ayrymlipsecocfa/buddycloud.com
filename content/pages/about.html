            <h2>Where are we now?</h2>
              <p>Buddycloud is an open source project that helps developers add chat, video and social features to their app 
              without being locked into a proprietary solution. We do this by producing an open source messaging server and 
              working with standards committees to ensure everything we do is open and free for others to use.</p>
              <p>The Buddycloud team provides customers with support, licensing and consulting to help them integrate user to
              user, group and social messaging into their product. We also love working with our community: they help us grow
              the ecosystem of Buddycloud into more than a one-off product: components available for other developers. 
              We strive to build open systems that others can adapt and extend into their exact needs. And, we believe that 
              communication systems are better when they interconnect. This is why we designed Buddycloud so that anyone can 
              run their own server and connect with other sites also running Buddycloud.</p>
              <p>Buddycloud customers benefit from quickly and securely adding real-time messaging to their applications so 
              they can focus on their core app development.</p>
              <p>Today, Buddycloud is feature complete, tested and working in 8 countries and between nearly a million users.
              Most recently we helped a South African internet service provider add messaging between their 500k users.</p>

            <p>We are designing the communication system for the next 30 years.</p>
            <p>Email has powered the last 30 years of internet communication. Email was successful because of it's open design: developers could read the specification and build their own server and clients. And users could communicate reliably with any other users that had an email address.</p>
            <p>Social media points to a new way to build communication tools. But until now all solutions have been closed and depended on a <a href="https://twitter.com" target="blank">single</a>
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="blank">provider.</a> Developers have had to agree to use API keys [that can be revoked] and users have only been able to communicate with users on that platform.</p>
            <p>In an era when people are increasingly distrusting of centralized services, We are building on the ethos of the best hopes of the Internet: distributed and decentralised.</p>
            <p>We're at the point where we can reinvent communication and it's very exciting.</p>
            <p>To build for the next 30 years we look at what made email such a successful system. At Buddycloud towers, we are guided by the principles of open design, a royalty-free specifications and a federated design that empowers users communication with friends on other sites and applications.</p>
            <p>We look forward to you playing a part.</p>
