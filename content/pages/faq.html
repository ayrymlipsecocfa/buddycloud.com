        <h2>The Product and Service.</h2>
        <h3>What is Buddycloud?</h3>
          <p>Buddycloud is an open source project that helps developers add chat, video and social features to their app 
          without being locked into a proprietary solution. We do this by producing an open source messaging server and 
          working with standards committees to ensure everything we do is open and free for others to use.</p>
          <p>The Developer components of Buddycloud ship as the BC:Core product.</p>
        <h3>How is Buddycloud different?</h3>
          <p>Buddycloud is different:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>The ability to build services that interoperate with other sites using federation give you access to a much 
          larger user community. Your users can find friends on other services and access Buddycloud content anywhere on 
          the internet.</li>
          <li>Unlike other messaging stacks, Buddycloud can also be run on-premises, giving you total control over how you
          decide to integrate your messaging stack with external services (for example your user database).</li>
          <li>Buddycloud's open design keeps you flexible: Instead of building a closed and proprietary system, we took the
          best of open protocols and built on them. Then we  released this all as open source so you can innovate and avoid
          service lock-in.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Who uses Buddycloud?</h3>
          <p>A community of 500+ developers and many organisations are currently building products on Buddycloud. Corporate 
          customers include Government departments, ISPs and Game developers.</p>
        <h3>Is it a messaging app?</h3>
          <p>Buddycloud is a service for developers to build their own apps. There are two demo apps:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://buddycloud.org/">web demo</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buddycloud">android demo</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Buddycloud <a href="http://buddycloud.com/software-stack">software ecosystem pages</a> give a full list of 
          applications.</p>
        <h3>What benefit does Buddycloud add that I don't already have?</h3>
          <p>BC:Core, a set of tools, libraries and services to build user-to-user, group and social messaging into your apps.
          Check out all the <a href="https://buddycloud.com/software-stack">Buddycloud components</a> and use those that
          your users need.</p>
          <p>If you are a community, you can use BC:Communities and Channels to easily build a community in your existing 
          site. <a href="http://buddycloud.com/contact">Get in contact with us</a> to know more about this Buddycloud product.</p>
        <h2>The Design and Technology.</h2>
        <h3>Which platforms are supported?</h3>
          <p>Buddycloud supports <a href="https://github.com/buddycloud/buddycloud-server-java">Web</a> and 
          <a href="https://github.com/buddycloud/buddycloud-android">Mobile</a> application development with SDKs for the
          main platforms.</p>
          <p>The BC:Core components run on any unix-like system.</p>
          <p>Buddycloud uses the Postgres database.</p>
          <p>Buddycloud can be setup to authenticate against your existing user databases (external-auth).</p>
        <h3>How do users control privacy?</h3>
          <p>Users should always know what information is shared and with whom. We've designed Buddycloud to avoid privacy
          confusion and developed three ways to share:</p>
          <p>A selected few trusted users: a private channel, for example <code>surprise-party@my-domain.com</code></p>
          <p>Just people on the local domain: a local channel: for example <code>all-hands@company.com</code></p>
          <p>Open to the world: an open channel: for example <code>my-fans@ladygaga.com</code></p>
        <h3>How is Buddycloud licensed?</h3>
          <p>All <a href="http://buddycloud.com/software">Buddycloud software</a>, is developed in a transparent way and 
          released under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 licence</a></p>
